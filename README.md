# My SimpleBank
This is my personal implementation of a backend banking system, inspired by the [techschool/simplebank](https://github.com/techschool/simplebank) project.

## Tech Stack
- Golang
- PostgreSQL
- sqlc
- Docker
- REST API

## Learning Goals
- Practice Clean Architecture in Go
- Implement transaction-safe DB operations
- Write unit tests using Go's `testing` package
- Experiment with REST API
- Deploy to Kubernetes (coming soon)
